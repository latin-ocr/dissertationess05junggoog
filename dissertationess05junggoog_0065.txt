took, so to speak, its colour and name from that use, remaining always
spiritual as before. For instance, we speak of „the Colonial power“ ot
the Crown, meaning the Imperial power applied to the government of
the Colonies; in like manner the spiritual power of the Pope‚ applied
indirectly to temporal things, was (improprie) improperly calledTempo· '
ral, and this usus loquendi gave rise to much misinterpretation.“ —
Ostendit dein Bellarminum jam ita censuisse, et citat inter alia illa Bell-
armini: „That this power is in the Pope is not opinion but certitude
-among Catholics, though there be many discussions at to what and of
what quality the power is: that is to say, whether it be properly and
in itself of a temporat kind, or whether it be no rather spiritual, but by
a certain necessary consequence, and in order to spiritual ende, it dispose
of temporal things.“ (O. Barelay c. 3.) Dein prosequitur: „Now, from
these passages it would appear, that in Bellarmines judgment the opi-
nions of the Canonists and the Theologiaus practically come to one and
the same thing, though their language was different. By Temporal
power some earlier Canonists may perhaps have intended a power tem·
poral in itself 3 but the later Canonists did not intend more than a
Spiritual power over temporal things: which the Theologians also as·
'serted But this use of the word temporat seemed to imply, that the
quality of the power was not spiritual, as the Theologians asserted. This
ambiguity is the source of the misunderstanding-e, which we daily read
-in attacks upon the Catholic Church.“
